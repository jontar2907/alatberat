# How to Fix Mailpit Connection Error in Laravel

The error:
```
Connection could not be established with host "mailpit:1025": stream_socket_client(): php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo for mailpit failed: No such host is known.
```
is caused because the hostname "mailpit" is not resolvable in your environment.

## Steps to Fix

1. Open your `.env` file in the root of your Laravel project.

2. Locate the mail configuration variables:
```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailpit
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
```

3. Update the `MAIL_HOST` value:
- If you are running Mailpit locally, change `MAIL_HOST=mailpit` to:
```
MAIL_HOST=localhost
```
- If you are not using Mailpit, replace `MAIL_HOST` with your SMTP server hostname.

4. Alternatively, for local development where you do not want to send real emails, you can set:
```
MAIL_MAILER=log
```
This will log emails instead of sending them.

5. Save the `.env` file.

6. Restart your Laravel development server to apply the changes:
```
php artisan serve
```

7. Test the email sending functionality again.
